# SD_collisions
Using geospatial data, we explore whether the location of popular clubs and bars in San Diego County is related to traffic collisions reported between 2015 and 2019. We define traffic collisions to broadly encompass any traffic violation that is reported and documented in the county's publicly available dataset. Note that these collisions involve events as serious as DUIs to minor breaches such as tailgating related collisions. In addition to analyzing the proximity of traffic collisions to San Diego nightlife, we explore whether car accidents are significantly more likely to occur at certain times of the day (e.g., midnight) or certain days of the week (e.g., Saturdays). Lastly, we explore whether there exists any police biases that lead certain groups of people to be stopped and questioned by the police for significantly longer periods of time.
